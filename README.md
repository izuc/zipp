## About ZIPP

### Introduction

ZIPP, short for Zone Internet Peer Protocol, is an endeavor to combine decentralized data storage with secure access methodologies. Partnering with IOTA's 2.0 prototype for initial testing, ZIPP aspires to create a platform that emphasizes privacy and decentralization.

### ZIPP Vision and Purpose

"The purpose of the ZIPP network is to pioneer a decentralized and secure avenue for running applications, facilitating communication, and enabling seamless information sharing between users. We envision an ecosystem that stands free from ownership, external control, and manipulation. The ZIPP protocol embodies the spirit of a free internet, a realm where data can be hosted without fear of reprisal. Our goal is to craft a network that is scalable, incentivized, user-friendly, and accessible to all at no cost. While we champion freedom, ZIPP is not intended for illegal activities but as a beacon of a free and transparent internet." - Lance.

### Core Focus

ZIPP amalgamates the robustness of IPFS, the privacy-centric features of TOR, and the economic incentives of IOTA's 2.0 prototype to lay the groundwork for a next-generation decentralized internet.

#### Technical Foundation
- **Distributed Data Hosting with IPFS:** ZIPP harnesses the power of IPFS for decentralized data storage. Files are compressed using 7z, encrypted with AES-256, and then fragmented across the IPFS network, ensuring redundancy, speed, and security.
- **Anonymous Communication via TOR:** All network communication within ZIPP is routed through TOR, ensuring users' privacy and security against potential surveillance or data breaches.
- **Economic Layer with ZIPP Coin:** ZIPP introduces its own standalone coin named ZIPP, ensuring transactions remain separate and secure, while also providing an incentive mechanism for network participants.

#### Scope
ZIPP's primary objective is to revolutionize internet communication by weaving together these potent technologies. The platform's essence lies in its modular node software, designed for adaptability and scalability. This open-source approach encourages community-driven enhancements, especially in the areas of routing and zoning between nodes. One of ZIPP's standout features is its ability to incentivize data hosting, where participants are rewarded for ensuring data longevity and availability.

By uniting these technologies under a single umbrella, ZIPP seeks to lay the groundwork for a decentralized, incentivized, and user-centric internet of the future.
